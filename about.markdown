## About Me

Hey, my name is Jack. I am a third year Computing Undergraduate at Imperial College London.

### Education
Imperial College London (2017-2021)

Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form (2015-2017)

The Billericay School (2010-2015)

### Why Computing?

I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn’t accept their validity. I was extremely intrigued, and so decided to complete my Extended Project on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I am learning more about it.

### Other interests

I'm currently learning how to Skydive, and plan to get my A Licence.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop. I play the Piano.

When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country. I also love to travel - see my travel progress [here](/map).
