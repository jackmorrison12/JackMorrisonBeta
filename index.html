    Hey, my name is Jack. I am a third year Computing Undergraduate at Imperial College London. Before studying at Imperial, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form.
    <br><br>
    I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn’t accept their validity. I was extremely intrigued, and so decided to complete my Extended Project on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I want to learn more about it.
    <br><br>
    In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop. When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country. I also love to travel - see my travel progress here.
