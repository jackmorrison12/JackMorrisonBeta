  long_desc: "This was our end of second year group project, where the brief was to create a webapp. We decided to create a news feed with a difference. The aim was to encourage people to change up their news sources and read some new material in order to \"Burst their Bubble\". We wrote it using React for the frontend and Python/Java for the backend, and used a MongoDB database."

  long_desc: "We chose to recreate the classic game of snake on a 32x32 LED matrix. We did this by using a hat for the Raspberry Pi to connect it to the matrix, and created 4 modes for the game, one of which was an Artificial Intelligence. We also created an arcade-machine inspired box for the project, and created all of our own sounds too.<br>This project won the prize for the best group project extension, judged by the creators of the Raspberry Pi themselves."

We looked at Convolutional Neural Networks, along with Semantic Segmentation, as these are the most commmonplace in medical imaging. We then looked at overlapping topics, these being the uses of AI in radiology, and a deeper case study into the user for detection of lung cancer."
