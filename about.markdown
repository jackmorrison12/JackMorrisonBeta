All of the content on this site is generated using the static website generator Jekyll.

The original version of this site was created when I was 16 as part of a school project. I wrote it in basic HTML and CSS, and therefore it has become unsustainable as more pages have been added, as there is a lot of duplication. That's why I decided to migrate it to something more sustainable.

However, since I host the site using Github Pages, dynamic sites are not supported. After some internet research, I discovered a static solution: Jekyll. My initial project is to export my current site, reducing all of the code duplication, which I am currently doing. Once this is complete, it will be much easier to update with more content.
