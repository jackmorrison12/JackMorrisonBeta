### About Me

Hey, my name is Jack. I am a third year Computing Undergraduate at Imperial College London. 
Before studying at Imperial, I studied at The Billericay School and Westcliff High School for Boys Sixth Form.

I first realised I wanted to study computing when my A Level maths teacher started discussing computer-assisted proofs, and why some people didn’t accept their validity. I was extremely intrigued, and so decided to complete my Extended Project on it. Since then, I have realised that computer science is a much wider area than just writing programs, and that is why I want to learn more about it.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to a wide variety of music, especially pop. When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my friends all over the country. I also love to travel - see my travel progress [here](/map).

### About The Site

All of the content on this site is generated using the static website generator Jekyll.

The original version of this site was created when I was 16 as part of a school project. I wrote it in basic HTML and CSS, and therefore it has become unsustainable as more pages have been added, as there is a lot of duplication. That's why I decided to migrate it to something more sustainable.

Initially, I wanted to do something dynamic. However, since I host the site using Github Pages, dynamic sites are not supported. I considered switching hosting provider, but after some internet research, I discovered a static solution: Jekyll. I thought this would be a fun challenge.

My initial project is to export my current site, reducing all of the code duplication, which I am currently doing. Once this is complete, it will be much easier to update with more content.

The github repo for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/jackmorrison12/jackmorrison12.github.io "Website Github Repo").
